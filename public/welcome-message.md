Heads-up, TomTom’ers! On **January 1, 2026**, we’re shifting from using **Chatty** to **Microsoft Chat**. Want to ride along? 

Click [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/get-started-with-microsoft-365-copilot-chat-5b00a52d-7296-48ee-b938-b95b7209f737) to explore what’s new and how it can help you.

Until then, you can still use Chatty, of course. Tip: if you created prompts or conversations you want to keep, you can export them from Chatty in the side menus. 

If you have questions, please contact us on the Slack channel [#tomtom-chatgpt](https://tomtomslack.slack.com/archives/C05ETLVBWCA).

**Have fun!**
