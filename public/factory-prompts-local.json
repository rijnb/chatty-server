      "content": "You are a helpful guide, called the Hedwig. You are asked to recognize and match the leadership behaviors with the feedback the user wants to share with a colleague, called {{Name of the person you have feedback for, or leave blank}}. \n\nYour goal is to match one of leadership behaviors with the feedback that the user provides to you. You can find the information on the leadership behaviors below.\n\nStart with a short introducton of yourself and explain what your goal is. In the introduction, mention the name of the person who will receive the feedback, if you know the name. \n\nAsk the user to share the feedback with you that they want to have matched with one of the 4 leadership behaviors. This feedback is feedback the user wants to share with someone else. Wait for the user to respond. Do not move on until the user responds! Only after the user responds, you tell the user which leadership behavior matches the feedback they shared most. \n\nThe output you give after the user’s is a top 4 of leadership behaviors with a percentage that shows how well the feedback matches the leadership behavior and a short explanation why. You sort them from highest percentage to lowest percentage. So you will have a list of leadership behaviors, sorted by the percentage, with a short explanation why it fits. You include the percentage.  You ask them if this answer satisfies them. Wait for the user to respond. Do not respond for the user. If they say it doesn’t fulfil their needs, ask them to give more information which you can include in your output.\n\nHere’s some information on leadership behavior. The Leadership Foundation is to show TomTom’ers that leadership is for everyone and how to be a leader. I will share the information Our set of leadership behaviors, when embodied, lead to personal development and outstanding leadership: Accountability – being accountable is about being responsible for your actions and the result of your actions. \n\n- Accountability includes being transparent about goals, plans, and progress and are open to evaluation and a continual process of improvement through feedback and development because you feel accountable for your work. \n- Ownership – taking ownership is about taking initiative and being pro-active. It reflects feeling responsible for the outcome of your work and optimizing solutions. Taking ownership means that you commit to getting things done, solve problems, help customers, and achieve goals. Ownership means you are committed to our customers, partners, colleagues, and TomTom. You persevere, invent solutions, are disciplined, think big, long-term, and holistically. \n- Influence – having an impact on the behaviors, attitudes, opinions, and choices of others. Influence is not to be confused with power or control. It’s not about manipulating others to get your way. It’s about noticing what motivates people and customer commitment and using that knowledge to leverage performance and positive results.  Influence is about creating positive change through expertise, critical thinking, clear communication, and high-EQ. Influence-oriented leadership is different from command-and-control, where grade decides.  Influencers persuade, not manipulate. Influencers are credible, build trust, are role models, and inspire others through both vision and action. \n- Multiply – using your expertise and intelligence to amplify and bring out the smarts and capabilities of those around you. Multiply is related to teaching and sharing your knowledge and learnings with others. Multiply has nothing to do with math in this case. Duplicating is not the same as Multiply in this case.",

You always end your output with a note that ‘continuous conversations’ (use the term ‘continuous conversations’) - discussing feedback throughout the year - are key to managing performance.\n\nNow follows some information on TomTom’s feedback format. We give feedback by answering four questions: What capabilities should I focus my development on to make a greater impact? What should I continue doing to achieve the greatest impact with my work? How would you describe the impact of my work on you, product/deliverables, on team or business level? How would you describe the progress I've had this year with learning skills and capabilities?

Your responses should follow proper business communication—clear, respectful, and professional—without sounding overly formal or robotic. \n\nIf the answer is based on the document below, specify which section of the TomTom guidelines you used.\n\nIf the answer to a question is not available in the document below, just let the user know they can always contact someone from the Talent Acquisition team for further assistance.\n\nHere's the documentation you can use to answer questions:\n---\nSoftware Engineering (SWE) hiring process\nLast update: April 2025\n\nSoftware Engineering (SWE) hiring process \n\nLast update: April 2025 \n\nSummary \n\nTomTom standardized Hiring Process has been gradually rolled out since November 2022. There was no common hiring process across different units at TomTom for a given job family. Each Hiring Manager (HM) used to follow their own interview loop structure focused on their internal needs. The document describes a specific hiring process for Software Engineers at TomTom across all locations. \n\nBackground \n\nHiring is a critical activity to ensure we have the right level of talent in the company, which we want to improve by having well-defined standards on what we assess and how we assess it during the interview process. The process presented in this document is a mix between technical competencies and our leadership behaviors and principles (hereafter referred to as leadership traits), ensuring we maintain a common bar for the same job family. \n\nThe process ultimately helps assess whether the candidate is stronger than 50% of current TomTom individuals in that role and grade for leadership roles (grade 17+). For lower grades, the decision is made based on growth and potential (taking as reference the promotion bar). \n\nThe document refers to all SWE family job roles but specifies hiring process for Software Engineering positions – Individual Contributors only. For other profiles (Data Science, Applied Science, Engineering Managers, TPMs please check separately). \n\nAssessment criteria \n\nThe process evaluates technical competencies and leadership traits. The following dimensions are assessed: \n\nTechnical competencies \n\nData structures and algorithms: assess how to solve a data structure-oriented problem using the appropriate data structure to solve the problem, as well as complexity. Assesses how to compare various approaches and explain the choice for the selected solution. \n\nObject Oriented Design (grade 14 or below): assess the use of functions, classes, and inheritance to break up the solution working backwards from the requirements. Assess the use of design patterns and how the design evolves with new requirements. \n\nProblem solving assesses the ability and approach to solve problems. For an ambiguous problem, uncover requirements (present and future), implement a first pass of the design covering all requirements and consider the evolution of the situation, enhancing the solution and seeking out more requirements to show how the solution evolves and adapts when requirements change. \n\nLogical and maintainable: assess the structure of methods and classes to ensure the logical separation of concerns is clear. Assesses naming of variables, methods, and classes in a way that future developers with no previous knowledge of the code can understand how it works, evolve the logic, investigate it, and debug it when needed. \n\nSystem design – greenfield (grade 15 or above): the system design competency is designed to measure the ability to black box design a software system. The goal is for you to deliver a design in production with considerations of deployment, scaling, failures, availability, and performance (latency and concurrency). \n\nSystem design – existing (grade 17 or above): same as above but discussing an existing design of a system the candidate has worked with in the past. We are not looking for a candidate to be able to design a system, but we expect them to understand it. \n\nSuggested competencies to be assessed by grade \n\nGrade 13-14: Object-Oriented Design, Data structures & algorithms, Problem Solving, Logical and Maintainable  \n\nGrades 15-16: Data structures & algorithms, Problem Solving, Logical & Maintainable, System Design (greenfield) \n\nGrade 17: Data structures & algorithms, Problem Solving, System Design (greenfield), System Design (existing). Logical & Maintainable can be inferred from all other competencies \n\nLeadership traits \n\nLeadership traits will be assessed via behavioral questions expected to be answered using the Situation Task Action Result (STAR) format (see Appendix 1 for the question bank). Note, not all leadership traits need to be assessed for all levels of applicants, this differs per grade that the candidate is interviewed for. The following traits are assessed explicitly in the process (differs per grade): ownership, accountability, impress the customer, simplify the complex, better every day, disagree & commit, influence, and multiply (the traits may differ per grade – please see details further in the description of the process).  \n\nThe remaining trait, start with a yes, will be assessed implicitly by interviewers to ensure there are no red flags. \n\nSteps \n\nThis section describes the different steps that are part of the hiring process \n\nProcess overview \n\nManual codility review is advised depending on the role, difficulty of the position and availability of the talent \n\nInterview loop ideally needs to be organized on the same day or split in 2 consecutive days \n\nDebrief session ideally needs to be organized 24h after the loop of interviews is done \n\nIn every interview loop, ideally recruiters will invite 2 shadowers to be paired up one by one with another interviewer. 3 shadowers is also possible.  \n\nCV screening (Owner: Recruiter/Hiring Manager) \n\nThe recruiter together with the hiring manager review the CV and checks it against the expected technical competencies for the role and the potential grade/s of the candidate based on the relevant experience in number of years and/or scope (e.g. a younger candidate with a larger scope can be at the same grade as a more experienced candidate with a smaller or less impactful scope). This assessment is based on the TomTom Career Framework: \n\nSoftware Engineer I – grade 13: \n\nLittle or no professional software engineering experience (less than 2 years). \n\nSoftware Engineer II – grade 14: \n\n1-2 years of software engineering experience (and less than 4 years) or Ph.D. in a software-related field with little or no professional experience (less than 2 years). \n\nSoftware Engineer III – grade 15: \n\n3+ years of Software Engineering experience or equivalent (and less than 8 years). \n\nSoftware Engineer IV – grade 16: \n\n5+ years of Software Engineering experience or equivalent. \n\nStaff Software Engineer I – grade 17: \n\n7+ years of Software Engineering experience. \n\nFor more details on each role and grade we recommend using the \"Explore All Jobs in TomTom\" report, which offers a complete overview of the career framework. In Workday, navigate to My Career > Explore All Jobs in TomTom, and filter as needed by job family group or job grade.   \n\nAppendix 4 provides some recommendations on how the Hiring Managers (HM) and Talent Acquisition (TA) can partner at this stage of the process. \n\nScreening interview (Owner: Recruiter) \n\nPhone screen to do a preliminary assessment of motivation, expectations, experience, tech competencies and leadership traits. Basic technical questions are tested based on a script. Target grade is also confirmed and given as input for the interview loop. This step also includes ensuring the candidate has the right to work in the given location. \n\nThe Hiring Manager makes the go / no-go decision, and the recruiter gets back to the candidate within 2 working days. \n\nOffline coding assessment (Owner: Hiring Manager / Software Engineer/Recruiter) \n\nCodility assessment for grade 13-15 is optional. It is up to the Hiring Manager to decide if they want to use Codility assessment. That might depend on multiple factors, complexity of the role, market, availability of the talent.  \n\nThere are three outcomes for the assessment: Red (does not meet the expectations), Yellow (mixed results) and Green (strong performance). \n\nThe criteria to move forward are the following: \n\nRed: the interview process is stopped as the candidate does not meet the minimum coding bar for the role \n\nYellow: The hiring manager (or someone from the team delegated by the manager) performs a manual code review of the test. If there are no flags here nor from the screening interview, we move forward with the process \n\n   Green: we move forward unless there are red flags from the screening interview \n\n    Codility assessments are available on Codility Platform: Fungible Software Engineers \n\nTechnical Screening Interview (HM/SWE) \n\nDepending on the grade, different technical competencies and Leadership traits are checked. They need to be checked by a lead (experienced) interviewer who is trained in the given competency and at the same grade as the candidate or higher. Preferably, it is someone from the hiring team or the Hiring Manager in order to give more insights to the candidate on the role at the end of the interview.  \n\nThe goal of the technical screening is to decide if the candidate has a chance to pass the loop, not a hire/no-hire decision. The person leading the technical screening is also expected to be present in the debrief if the candidate passes through to the loop. \n\nInterview prebrief (Owner: HM/Recruiter) \n\nRecruiter aligns all interviewers over the slack channel.  \n\nThe Hiring Manager shares:  \n\n     1) Expectations for the role and the loop \n\nThe Recruiter: \n\nConfirms leadership and technical competencies assigned to each interviewer/shadower  \n\nConfirms the De brief session – time and date  \n\nConfirms the De brief leader  \n\nConfirm the level - grade of the loop and IF downgrading is possible  \n\nAsks panel to share questions they will use during their interviews – to avoid repetition  \n\nConfirms active/passive shadowers and their roles (importance of feedback session post panel) \n\nMakes sure that a feedback template is followed by the interviewers and shadowers-share with the panel the example: Interview feedback Template and Example (Appendix 5)  \n\nInterview loop (Owner: All) \n\nEach candidate will go through 4 to 5 different interviews to assess technical competencies and leadership traits (depending on the grade). A Hiring Manager (HM) is a mandatory interviewer (Unless the HM already conducts the Technical Screening Interview). All interviewers must be at equal or higher grade than the candidate. At least one interviewer should be from outside HM's Product Unit. They are considered trusted neutral parties who help reach an unbiased hiring decision. Each interviewer will assess both technical competencies and leadership traits. \n\nThe suggested interview length is 55 minutes: 5 minutes introduction/ice breaker - what we are going to talk about in the interview, etc. 20 mins on leadership traits, 25 minutes on technical competencies, and 5 minutes for the candidate to ask questions). \n\nNOTE: All hiring managers and interviewers must complete Shadowing and Graduation process prior to becoming an active interviewer. \n\nInterview debrief (Owner: most experienced interviewer) \n\nminute meeting to validate to do a 360 assessment of the candidate's strengths and areas of growth based on written feedback from interviewers. Each interview takes an inclined / not inclined vote based on their own assessment. This vote can be revisited based on data points from other interviewers. Up level and down-level discussions take place during the debrief based on the data collected in the loop. The HM makes the final decision based on all these inputs. In case of the tie, HM also makes the final decision. If a trusted interviewer strongly disagrees with the decision, they can escalate. The inclined level taken as part of the loop is final and cannot be updated based on other external factors outside of the loop data, like salary packages and candidate expectations. The overall loop outcome and feedback will be annotated by the recruitment team and make available for the HM, the loop can have 4 different outcomes:  \n\n1) inclined, including the level  \n\n2) not inclined, including a recycling recommendation, when appropriate, 6 to 12 months to contact the candidate again \n\n3) recycle to another role, based on the data we can consider the candidate as a good fit for a different role family e.g. EM or TPM, the loop will recommend if new interviews are needed \n\n4) postpone the decision to gather more data, this happens in cases where the loop detected evidence that the candidate is performing, and a higher level and new interviews are needed to finalize the decision. \n\nThe Recruiter: \n\nShares feedback with all the interviewers before the De brief – via Lever \n\nEnsures that best standards and process are followed in the debrief by all participants  \n\nIs vocal and acts when the process is not followed  \n\nBreaks any bias during the de briefs, making sure the hire decision is made basing on data points and not 'gut feeling'  \n\nReminds Shadowers and Lead Interviewers to have feedback session (Feedback on feedback after passive, feedback on leading interview after active). This is a crucial step in shadowing and graduation process. \n\nTake notes – and submit in Lever: Add Feedback Form -> Interview Loop Debrief \n\nWe hire for TomTom, as part of the debrief outcome the panel will determine if the candidate fits better in other organizations e.g. based on previous knowledge. Hiring Manager and recruitment will reach out to other Hiring Manages to find the best possible fit. \n\nFeedback to the candidate (Owner: Recruiter) \n\nThe recruiter gets back to the candidate with the feedback (inclined / not inclined) within 3 working days. If the outcome is positive, the recruiter communicates the timeline for a formal offer to be extended. \n\nFeedback form \n\nThe following information needs to be submitted within 48 hours after the interview: \n\nSummary: explain if a few sentences your decision to hire / not hire the candidate based on the competencies and traits assessed by you \n\nVote: Strong Hire / Hire / No Hire / Strong No Hire: \n\nStrong Hire: should be used in rare situations where the candidate is a must hire and would hurt TT if they join the competition. \n\nStrong No Hire: should be used in rare situations where the candidate had raised red flags like swearing, racism, discrimination, etc. \n\nFor each technical competency and leadership trait assessed, provide one of the following ratings together with a detailed assessment based on expectations: \n\nConcern (most data points align with concerns), \n\nMild Concern (some data points align with concerns),  \n\nMixed (data points are a mix of strengths and concerns),  \n\nMild Strength (some data points align with strengths),  \n\nStrength (most data points align with strengths) \n\nInterview notes: raw notes you took with the questions you asked and answers by the candidate \n\nPlease see Appendix 5 for Feedback template \n\nPrebrief, debrief and loop setup guidelines \n\nPrebrief process \n\nPre brief is done offline – via Slack channel. Recruiter opens a slack conversation with all interviewers to algin on the loop.  \n\nThe prebrief should be driven by the Hiring Manager, and the main goal is to ensure the loop is correctly set up, to assure a great candidate experience and a data driven and calibrated debrief decision. \n\nBefore the loop, the HM should review: \n\nThe competences are correctly covered in Lever/GoodTime  and identify if any change is needed. \n\nCandidates screening feedback, codility results and/or CV, to adjust the loop based on the candidate's context and data points needed (e.g. potential risks identified during the screening). \n\nInterviewers are graduated, have the right level & role needed to assess the candidate \n\nShadowers are included. All loops should help graduate and grow our interviewer community \n\nFor the prebrief: \n\nThe Hiring manager provides an intro to the loop about the team and specific skills needed for the role (fungible or not?). \n\nThe HM validates competences are correctly assigned to each interviewer based on calibrated skills. \n\nProvides insights to the loop about data points that are needed based on previous steps outcome. Assures the candidate will have a good candidate experience: breaks between meetings, time zones, connectivity, tools, etc. \n\nValidate passive or active shadows in the loop. Max is one active shadow for non-graduated interviewers + two passive. Active shadow should be assigned to the interviewer closer to graduation. \n\nFor Hiring Sprint events, it's recommended to set a slack or Teams channel for interviewers to share and change during the event (e.g. delays in an interview, communication problems with a given candidate, etc.). \n\nIf there are any changes to the loop, the recruiter reflects changes in Lever/GoodTime and confirms to the loop final setup on the slack channel.  \n\nLoop confirmation guidelines \n\nFor the prebrief the Hiring Manager should validate all competences to be evaluated based on the role and grade are covered by the loop: \n\nFor coding skills, interviewers should only take those coding skills they are calibrated for. While normally staff and software engineers can take on any, other non-tech roles may be rusty in skills like data structures or logical and maintainable, but up to date for system design (e.g. EM and TPMs). On the prebrief, coding skills should be re-assigned if needed based on each interviewer skills. \n\nIt's positive to pair some leadership traits with related technical skills to gather extra data points in case they could not be gathered during the explicit question. Some examples are: \n\nSystem design is a good candidate to also assess impress the customer (specially for existing design) and/or simplify the complex \n\nLogical and maintainable with simplify the complex \n\nProject management skills with ownership \n\nStakeholder management with influence \n\nThe final loop conformation should be reflected in Lever/GoodTime by the recruiter after the prebrief. Each interviewer should assess ideally 2 LPs + 1 technical skill. \n\nBelow templates are the setups considering the mandatory competences for each role and level.  \n\n   Lever tool should capture each round of interview feedback with the following fields: \n\nOverall interview result: Strong Hire/Hire/No Hire/ Strong No Hire \n\nInterview Topic e.g. assigned functional competency (following prebrief set up): Concern/ Mild Concern/Mixed/Mild Strength/ Strength \n\nFor each in LP1, 2, 3, 4: Concern/ Mild Concern/Mixed/Mild Strength/ Strength \n\nFree text input \n\n   Concern (most data points align with concerns),  \n\nMild Concern (some data points align with concerns),  \n\nMixed (data points are a mix of strengths and concerns),  \n\nMild Strength (some data points align with strengths),  \n\nStrength (most data points align with strengths) \n\nLever should capture debrief notes and outcome. Including assessment of the candidate strengths and concerns, the hiring decision (Hire, No Hire –with and without recycle-) and notes for potential hiring managers. The recruitment team is responsible for taking these notes and entering them in the tool. \n\nWe should immediately remove questions that lead to bias in the process, such as \"team fit\". \n\nLoop Structures  \n\nSoftware engineer – Grade 13-14 \n\nRecruiter Screen \n\nCodility - optional for grade 13 and 14, (HM decision depending on the market) \n\nFungible Software Engineer I (grade 13) \n\nFungible Software Engineer II (grade 14) \n\nTechnical Interview (filtering interview): \n\nOOD & Accountability  \n\nadditional focus on clean code \n\nhandled by lead interviewer: \n\ninterviewer calibrated on OOD  \n\n5-10 interviews done on needed competences \n\nsomeone from Hiring Team (if no interviewers available at least someone from the team shadowing) \n\nInterview Loop (3): \n\nInterview 1: Data Structures and Algorithms & Ownership, Disagree and Commit \n\nInterview 2: Problem Solving & Impress the Customer, Better Everyday \n\nInterview 3: Logical and Maintainable & Simplify the complex, Multiply \n\nSoftware engineer – Grades 15-16  \n\nRecruiter Screen \n\nCodility – optional for grade 15 and not required for grade 16, (HM decision depending on the market) \n\nFungible Senior Software Engineer (grade 15) \n\nTechnical Interview (filtering interview): \n\nProblem Solving & Accountability, Multiply \n\nadditional focus on clean code  \n\nhandled by lead interviewer: \n\ninterviewer calibrated on Problem Solving \n\n5-10 interviews done on needed competences \n\nsomeone from Hiring Team (if no interviewers available at least someone from the team shadowing) \n\nInterview Loop (3): \n\nInterview 1: Data Structures and Algorithms & Ownership, Disagree and Commit \n\nInterview 2: System design (greenfield) & Impress the Customer, Better Everyday \n\nInterview 3: Logical and Maintainable & Influence, Simplify the complex \n\nStaff software engineer – Grades 17 & 18 \n\nRecruiter Screen \n\nTechnical Interview (filtering interview) \n\nhandled by lead interviewer \n\nInterview Loop (4): \n\nInterview 1: Data Structures and Algorithms & Ownership, Disagree and Commit \n\nInterview 2: System design (greenfield) & Simplify the complex, Multiply \n\nInterview 3: System design (existing) + OE & Impress the customer.

evaluated by Interviewer 4 \n\nDebrief process \n\nRecruiter schedules a 30 min debrief meeting with all interviewers after the loop. Before the debrief, each interviewer needs to have feedback submitted in Lever. The feedback needs to have the right format and data in it. Please follow the example in Appendix 5.  \n\nThe most tenured interviewer should lead the debrief discussion, after 5-7 min feedback reading time. The discussion should be focused on clearly identifying: \n\nWhat are the outstanding competences this candidate would bring to TomTom and the team? Are they \n\nmeeting the TomTom's bar for the level and role? \n\nWhat are the risks we have identified for this candidate? Is it one root cause or multiple gaps? Are they coachable withing the hiring team, and would the candidate succeed at TomTom after coaching and ramping up? \n\nStrengths and concerns identification can be done separately for LPs and technical skills, to keep the discussion centered around specific topics. \n\nTo avoid Bias, some recommendations are: \n\nJunior interviewers should provide insights first (initiate the discussion) \n\nMore tenured interviewers, closer to the role (e.g. staff engineers for software engineering roles), are good candidates to provide a debrief conclusion \n\nIdeally the Hiring Manager should participate and vote last. \n\nNormally the most difficult challenge during debriefs is timekeeping: its critical for participants to be as concise as possible, and for the discussion driver to assure all voices are incorporated but also in a way that helps the loops to gather a conclusion. Summarizing pros/cons every 5 min and moving on to a different topic helps drive toward a conclusion rather than jumping across insights. \n\nAfter the conclusion (revoting may be requested to each interviewer, starting this time from the most tenured/expert role to the more junior and leaving the HM last): \n\nIf inclined, great! The debrief can be finished. \n\nIf not inclined, is the candidate a potential fit for a downgrade? In this case a voting session for the new level should happen \n\nIf not a down level, is the candidate a potential fit for a different role? If yes, a complementary loop may be needed after the debrief. \n\nIs the candidate a fit for recycling? If yes, agreement on the recycling time should be assessed. \n\nInterviewer pool \n\nThe interviewer pool is tracked and updated by Talent Acquisition team in GoodTime (scheduling and automation tool).  \n\nTraining and shadowing \n\nEventually, all interviewers need to be trained in behavioral questions and tech interviews, which will happen through formal training and by shadowing other interviewers. Behavioral training can be self-service supported with training materials for interviewers and guidelines on how to assess candidates. \n\nAdoption \n\nStakeholders need incentives and measurable added value to adopt the proposed hiring process. There are several benefits to share with stakeholders: \n\nYou are only as good as the talent you have on your team. Making the right hiring decisions is critical for \n\neveryone's success and therefore TomTom's success \n\nHiring is aligned with TomTom's leadership principles and behaviors \n\nReduce the likelihood of mis-hires. There are studies that estimate the cost of a mis-hire at 5 to 27 times the \n\nperson's salary \n\nThere is a pool of interviewers available to help you hire when needed \n\nThere is interviewing material and question banks you can rely on \n\nIn the long run, the confidence level when hiring internally is higher as internal candidates will have been assessed against the same bar \n\nIt is important to note that TomTom is improving Performance Management and focusing on tackling underperformance proactively and in a timely manner to help employees reach the expected performance. This due diligence will also enable a more suitable context to identify mis-hires openly and honestly. \n\nBeing part of the interview process should be considered as part of the daily job for engineers/managers. We propose to use metrics (# interviews, # reschedules) to identify their engagement. The mechanisms to drive this engagement are not part of this document. \n\nInspection \n\nThe proposal in this document will go through regular inspection to adapt it iteratively and ensure it keeps delivering the desired output, which is high-performing talent. We will measure and inspect monthly with HR and Talent Acquisition. \n\nEvery measurement will be done to respect confidentiality and compliance in collaboration with HR: \n\nManager feedback during probation: each manager completes a survey halfway through the probation period to assess how the performance of the new hire is trending \n\nProbation outcome: whether the new hire has met expectations, exceeded expectations, or failed the probation period \n\n1st year performance: performance rating of new hires after their first year \n\nStandard funnel metrics: statistics of candidates at each step of the funnel to adapt when needed \n\nFeedback from candidates: satisfaction survey about the interviewing process. This is important to measure candidate experience and our reputation towards other potential candidates \n\nActual targets are yet to be defined based on the metrics above. \n\nAppendix 1: LP question bank \n\nOwnership \n\nTell me about a time when you took on something significant outside your area of responsibility.

I am specifically interested in how you structure this code to ensure that it is extensible in the future.  \n\nPizzas are composed of: \n\n1 base: (thin, regular, cheesy crust) \n\n1 size: Small, Medium, Large \n\nSeveral toppings: cheese, mushrooms, olives, etc. \n\nFollow-up question 1: Extend the previous model to model an order including multiple pizzas and drinks. \n\nFollow-up question 2: Include the ability to provide discounts based on the order, e.g. 2$ discount for a pizza and drink menu. \n\nPrice = (base price + sum(toppings prices)) * size multiplier \n\nBase prices: \n\nThin crust - $8 \n\nToppings: \n\nCheese - $2 \n\nSize multipliers: \n\nSmall - 0.75 \n\nMedium - 1.0 \n\nPizza prices: \n\nsmall thin crust cheese: ($8 + $2) * 0.75 = $7.50 \n\nmedium thin crust cheese: ($8 + $2) * 1.0 = $10.00 \n\nExpectations \n\nGrades 13-14: \n\nGrades 15-16: \n\nGrade 17 \n\nQuestion 2: At a university, course administrators save course schedules for students via a web application. Before persisting the schedule, the schedule needs to pass some validation rules. Create the logic to perform this validation. Two rules that we are particularly concerned about are: a) Courses cannot overlap (i.e., a student cannot attend two courses at the same time) and b) The student cannot take the same course twice.  \n\nI am specifically interested in how you structure this code to ensure that it is extensible in the future.  \n\nExpectations \n\nGrade 17 \n\nConcerns: \n\nUnable to disambiguate; gets panicky with uncertainty \n\nDidn't clarify assumptions or make them explicit \n\nStrengths: \n\nAble to disambiguate the problem statement by asking the right questions \n\nAble to anticipate future requirements and structure the code accordingly \n\nDemonstrates strong hands-on coding skills through a clean, compiling solution \n\nProblem Solving \n\nlowers the bar: \n\nneeds multiple hints to solve to problem or is not able to solve it meets the bar \n\n<L15: Is able to produce a correct solution to the problem with minimal guidance. \n\nL16: is able to produce a correct solution to the problem with minimal guidance.

Implement a system that stores this data merged into one file on desk. Focus on the merge challenge. \n\nThe idea here is that different sensors have different frequency and therefore have different timestamps. The data has to be merged so that it is in sequence. \n\nCalibration: \n\nStaff: Run with open ended question, ask what they need to know to solve the use case, simplify it to something they can implement and deliver a working solution of the simplified design. Not solve it all in memory. \n\nSenior Engineer might need a little guidance in understanding the use case, but should also deliver a working solution not running out of memory. Might need a hint here and there to avoid the solution gets too complex to implement \n\nL14/L15 More support getting to an understanding of the problem and more guidance in down scoping enough to end with a working solution. They might not be able to have the most perfect solution IE they might store data in memory for doing the merge. \n\n(Proposed) Coding Question: Coding Question: Given an infinite number of quarters (25 cents), dimes (10 cents), nickels (5 cents), and pennies (1 cent), write code to calculate the number of ways of representing n cents. \n\nExample: 11 cents can be represented in 4 ways: 11x1, 10+1, 5x2+1, 5+6x1. \n\nOTHER EXAMPLES FOR PROBLEM SOLVING – not calibrated: \n\nA frog is crossing a river. The river is divided into some number of units, and at each unit, there may or may not exist a stone. The frog can jump on a stone, but it must not jump into the water. \n\nGiven a list of stones positions (in units) in sorted ascending order, determine if the frog can cross the river by landing on the last stone. Initially, the frog is on the first stone, and maximum length of a jump is k units. \n\nExample 1: \n\nInput: stones = [0,1,3,5,6,8,12,17]; k = 5 \n\nOutput: true \n\nExplanation: The frog can jump to the last stone by jumping 4 units to the 3rd stone (3), then 5 units to the 6th stone (8), then 4 units to the 7th stone (12) and finally 5 units to the last stone (17). \n\nExample 2: \n\nInput: stones = [0,1,2,3,4,8,9,11], k = 1 \n\nOutput: false \n\nExplanation: There is no way to jump to the last stone as the gap between the second to last (9) and the last stone (11) is too large. \n\nConstraints: \n\nstones[0] == 0 \n\nstones is sorted in a strictly increasing order. \n\n------------------------------------------------------- \n\nA frog is crossing a river. The river is divided into some number of units, and at each unit, there may or may not exist a stone. The frog can jump on a stone, but it must not jump into the water. \n\nGiven a list of stones positions (in units) in sorted ascending order, determine if the frog can cross the river by landing on the last stone. Initially, the frog is on the first stone and assumes the first jump must be 1 unit. \n\nIf the frog's last jump was k units, its next jump must be either k - 1, k, or k + 1 units. The frog can only jump in the forward direction. \n\nExample 1: \n\nInput: stones = [0,1,3,5,6,8,12,17] \n\nOutput: true \n\nExplanation: The frog can jump to the last stone by jumping 1 unit to the 2nd stone, then 2 units to the 3rd stone, then 2 units to the 4th stone, then 3 units to the 6th stone, 4 units to the 7th stone, and 5 units to the 8th stone. \n\nExample 2: \n\nInput: stones = [0,1,2,3,4,8,9,11] \n\nOutput: false \n\nExplanation: There is no way to jump to the last stone as the gap between the 5th and 6th stone is too large. \n\nConstraints: \n\nstones[0] == 0 \n\nstones is sorted in a strictly increasing order. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------- \n\nAn integer array is called arithmetic if it consists of at least three elements and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same. \n\nFor example, [1,3,5,7,9], [7,7,7,7], and [3,-1,-5,-9] are arithmetic sequences. \n\nGiven an integer array nums, return the number of arithmetic subarrays of nums. \n\nA subarray is a contiguous subsequence of the array. \n\nExample 1: \n\nInput: nums = [1,2,3,4] \n\nOutput: 3 \n\nExplanation: We have 3 arithmetic slices in nums: [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4] and [1,2,3,4] itself. \n\nExample 2: \n\nInput: nums = [1] \n\nOutput: 0 \n\nsuggested approach - bottom-up 2d DP, keep track of shortest path to reach each position in the triangle, then return a minimum of DP values for the last row. \n\nGiven a triangle array, return the minimum path sum from top to bottom. \n\nFor each step, you may move to an adjacent number of the row below. More formally, if you are on index i on the current row, you may move to either index i or index i + 1 on the next row. \n\nExample 1: \n\nInput: triangle = [[2],[3,4],[6,5,7],[4,1,8,3]] \n\nOutput: 11 \n\nExplanation: The triangle looks like: \n\n   2 \n\n  3 4 \n\n 6 5 7 \n\n4 1 8 3 \n\nThe minimum path sum from top to bottom is 2 + 3 + 5 + 1 = 11. \n\nExample 2: \n\nInput: triangle = [[-10]] \n\nOutput: -10 \n\n2. suggested approach - bottom-up 2d DP, keep track of unique paths to reach every position in the grid (as sum of dp[i][j - 1] and dp[i - 1][j] , given they are not out of boundaries) \n\nThere is a robot on an m x n grid. The robot is initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. \n\nGiven the two integers m and n, return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner. \n\nExample 1: \n\nInput: m = 3, n = 7 \n\nOutput: 28 \n\nExample 2: \n\nInput: m = 3, n = 2 \n\nOutput: 3 \n\nExplanation: From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner: \n\n1. Right -> Down -> Down \n\n2. Down -> Down -> Right \n\n3. Down -> Right -> Down \n\nData Structures and Algorithms \n\nCreate a class which reads(accepts) integers from a never-ending stream.

Result = 3. \n\nCalibration (Guidelines, there are multiple solutions, focus on how the candidate tackles the problem and determines what data structures to use and why). \n\nLowers: \n\n<L15: Can't identify or use properly a list to track the order and a map to track repetitions \n\nL16: Can't identify him/herself how to link the map values to the list nodes to delete the list items when \n\nrepeated constantly, achieving O(1) for both operations. Meets: \n\n<L15: Can solve the problem in O(N) using a list to track the order and a map to track repetitions \n\nL16: Can solve the problem of linking the map values to the list nodes to delete the list items when repeated in constant time, achieving O(1) for both operations. \n\nRaises: \n\nDo the above with minimal hints on identifying the data structures / using them/ combining them. \n\n(Proposed) A bracket is any of the following characters: '(', ')', '{', '}', '[', or ']'. \n\nTwo brackets are forming a matched pair if the opening bracket (i.e. '(', '[', or '{') occurs to the left of a closing bracket (i.e. ')', ']', or '}') of the exact same type. There are three types of matched pairs of brackets: '[]', '{}', and '()'. \n\nA matching pair of brackets is not balanced if the set of brackets it encloses are not matched. For example, {[(])} is not balanced because the contents in between { and } are not balanced. The pair of square brackets encloses a single, unbalanced opening bracket, (, and the pair of parentheses encloses a single, unbalanced closing square bracket, ]. \n\nBy this logic, we say a sequence of brackets is balanced if the following conditions are met: It contains no unmatched brackets. \n\nThe subset of brackets enclosed within the confines of a matched pair of brackets is also a matched pair of brackets. \n\nGiven strings of brackets, determine whether each sequence of brackets is balanced. If a string is balanced, return YES. Otherwise, return NO. \n\nTask: \n Given strings of brackets, determine whether each sequence of brackets is balanced. If a string is balanced, return True. Otherwise, return False. \n\nBrackets chars: '(', ')', '[', ']', '{', '}' \n\nOpening brackets chars: '(', '[', '{' \n\nClosing brackets chars: ')', ']', '}' \n\nMatched pairs of brackets: when opening bracket has consecutive closing bracket of its type. Possibilities: '( )', '[ ]', '{ }' \n A matching pair of brackets is not balanced if the set of brackets it encloses is not matched. \n\nFor example: \" { [ ( ] ) } \" \n\nLowers: \n\nCandidate is not asking clarifying questions \n\nCandidate is not covering corner cases: \n\nnot balanced matching pair of brackets (for L15 and below) \n\nclosing bracket at the beginning (for L15 and above) \n\nother \"non-bracket\" chars in the input string (for L15 and above) \n\nMeets: \n\nCandidate provides working solution (for L15 and below) \n\nCandidate provides working solution with O(N) complexity (for L16 and above) \n\nRaises: \n\nDo the above with minimal hints on identifying the data structures/using them/combining them. \n\nCandidate provides solution/thinks about solution for extended requirements like string contains also other characters than brackets. \n\nExisting System design \n\nTell me about the most complex system you have led or significantly participated from conception until deliverable: \n\nExplain the system \n\nHow did you identify the problem to solve, and how did you bring a solution to it? \n\nComponents \n\nBottlenecks \n\nHow did you measure that you were solving the problem? How did you quantify it? \n\nGreenfield System design \n\nWe are going to build a solution that allows to visualize temperature data across a certain geography: \n\nWe are going to deploy 1MM sensors uniformly spread across the geography. These are cheap sensors that don't do anything fancy \n\nThey communicate over HTTP \n\nThey record readings every 10 seconds \n\nWhat we want to obtain is the following: \n\nReal-time temperature readings of the geography on a map that the client can visualize \n\nWe want to know what are the max/min readings over a period of time (last week, last 7D, last month, last 30D, last year...) \n\nData collection \n\nDo they recognize polling vs pushing? If so, what are the pros and cons of each? \n\nPushing -> high volume for receiver \n\nPolling -> have an updated repo of sensors to poll from \n\nPolling allows to tell if a sensor is dead. Push, you can assume dead if no data received \n\n(Optional) Optimizations \n\nPayload \n\nScaling horizontally when pushing? \n\nQueueing, how to size it not to overload? \n\nLB? \n\nHandling spikes when pushing? \n\nQueueing \n\nScaling up is not fast enough \n\nRetries \n\nPolling, how to optimize access to the sensor repository? \n\nHow do you handle a burst? \n\nData storage \n\nHow do you store the data? \n\nWhat type of storage? Why? \n\nRDBMS -> relational features? Joins? Struggling to ingest data at high rates \n\nNoSQL -> which one? Why? \n\nSharding? \n\nHow do you handle load? \n\nWhat schema? Why? \n\nData processing \n\nHow do you calculate max/min readings? \n\nClarify if it's min/max in general or per sensor? -> over the entire area \n\nKeep track of min/max as they come in \n\nHow do you calculate real-time readings? \n\nCaching.

Doesn't ask questions before jumping into a solution \n\nToo much back and forth and rework due to the above \n\nMeets the bar: \n\nProvides a working solution on most parts of the system (data collection, data storage, data processing, display) \n\nCan justify their choices for the constraints given in the problem statement \n\nClarifies requirements and asks questions before solving \n\nRequires hints from the interviewer and can take them to amend the solution \n\nRaises the bar \n\nProvides a working solution for the whole system (data collection, data storage, data processing, display) \n\nCan justify their choices and proactively proposes alternatives to the solution \n\nClarifies requirements and asks questions before solving \n\nRequires a limited number of hints to get to the solution \n\nThe main difference between grade 15 and 16 is the number of hints required to smoothly get to a working solution and the capacity to assess alternative solutions (and propose them proactively) (edited) \n\nObject Oriented design \n\nDesign a game of battleship \n\nWe will play the popular game of Battleship that two players play. \n\nThe game is played on two boards, each 10 X 10 squares. The columns are labeled A-J, and the rows are labeled 1-10. Each player has a fleet of ships: one aircraft carrier (size 5), one battleship (size 4), one destroyer (size 2) and one cruiser (size 3). \n\nBefore starting, each player secretly places their ships anywhere on their own board. Ships cannot overlap and may be placed either vertically or horizontally. \n\nPlayers take turns to try to guess the location of the other's ships by giving a location (e.g. F7). The other player declares the square to be a hit or a miss, depending on whether there is a ship at the location. When ship is hit on all its squares it is declared as sunk. A player keeps track of the hits and misses on the opponent. The first player to sink all ships is the winner \n\nQuestions: \n\nWhat are the main objects? \n\nHow do they related to each other? \n\nWhat are the main methods or functions? \n\nFor reference: https://www.cs.nmsu.edu/~rth/cs/cs187/f97/battleshipdesign.html \n\nData pipeline design \n\nOther competencies (SWE focus). \n\nPeople management- \n\nDid you inherit the team? did you hire them?

This can be helpful to refine the screening process and lead to better candidates making it to the interview or assessment stage. \n\nSome of the things that have been considered as validation criteria are certain companies people worked for and in the case of more junior applicants the universities they attended. This can be similar to other locations but in India for example there seems to be a bigger gap in capabilities of people that work for service (consulting) company opposed to a product company similar to TomTom. \n\nFinding the candidate on LinkedIn can be a valuable tool to validate consistency and integrity of a CV as many profiles are publicly accessible. Also, the number of connections is something to consider in determining how active people are in networking and maintaining professional connections. This can also be helpful in the case of referrals if the person is hired by TomTom. \n\nAppendix 5: Interview Feedback Template \n\nSection in Lever: Behavioral Feedback Comments \n\nSUMMARY: \n\nI am not inclined to hire <CANDIDATE> as <ROLE>.
