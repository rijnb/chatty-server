One way to help ensure your decision proposals meet that requirement is to give them a clear and intuitive structure.\n\nThe easiest way is to use one of the well-known structures described below. This page describe three different ways one could structure a decision or proposal document.\nNote that the structure alone is neither necessary nor sufficient: significantly more important is to write in a simple and clear style. Moments of crisis are when clarity is most beneficial, and so we should not compromise on taking the time to ensure clear communication, no matter what.\nFurthermore, clear writing is proof of thinking and scales the output of thinking to unlock coherence and parallelism at scale, which leads to increased impact.\n\nIt is a common misconception that people \"write to think.\" The most effective business writing comes from thinking, then writing. There are different ways to think, and different tools to support the thinking process. Writing is one of them, but it's important to recognize that if you write to think, you almost certainly will need to rewrite to be read.\n\nPyramid/Hypothesis Driven/Answer First/Minto\n\nThis document style is well known and has different names, but whatever the name, it has a 4-part structure: situation, complication, critical question, answer. It is an appropriate style when we are sure what the course of action should be. This certainty arises when it’s not a particularly hard decision; we only have one option; or we have performed significant analysis, are confident, and our proposal is evidence-backed. You can find various descriptions online and also a description from Charles Davies (former CTO, TomTom) here, and I highly recommend Barbara Minto’s The Pyramid Principle: an excellent book on clear communication.\n\nHere’s an elementary example:\n\nSituation: I’ve arrived at London Heathrow en route to Seattle and need to transfer to a different flight to get to a critical meeting tomorrow.\n\nComplication: My flight was 30 minutes late, and I missed my connection. The airline automatically rescheduled me to fly on the same flight tomorrow.\n\nCritical question: How can I get to Seattle in time?\nAnswer: Queue up at the ticket desk and demand they find a way to get me to Seattle.\n\nSupporting evidence: the meeting ends at 17:00, and the flight arrives at 19:00\nIt is not possible to reschedule the meeting. People have traveled.\nI’ve hired someone to watch the dog\nI’ve canceled other meetings tomorrow, so not going to Seattle will be wasteful.\nThey have helped me before and will probably help me again\nThe odds they get me there are higher because of my gold status\n\nReason 1: Arriving tomorrow evening is too late.\nReason 2: I invested time in the trip already and might as well get there.\nReason 3: I have gold member status on this airline\n\n5/3/1 format\n\nI tend to recommend people use what I call a “5/3/1” (or “5/3/1/–1/^Z”, pronounced \"five-three-one\") structure for decision documents. \n\nThis style is appropriate when there are several options, and the people proposing are unsure which is the right option and are requesting another (often more senior) leader to make a decision or are presenting options to a group. \n5-sentence description of the problem we are trying to solve \n3 1-sentence options identified to solve it \n1 preferred option of the three\n1 counterargument, or why what option could turn out to be wrong \n1 exit ramp if the counterargument is true\nHigh-level plan for the preferred option\n(Sentence counts are an aspiration, not a requirement.)\n\nI find 5/3/1’s more effective when there isn’t all that much analysis required. Forcing yourself to structure a topic using 5-3-1 will help you identify conclusions and solutions faster. Some people struggle with the –1 stage, but it’s a vital step to identify and mitigate against confirmation bias. \n\nHere’s a simple example:\n\n5: I’ve arrived at London Heathrow en route to Seattle. I need to transfer to a different flight for a critical meeting tomorrow. My flight was 30 minutes late, and I missed my connection. The airline automatically rescheduled me to fly on the same flight tomorrow. What should I do?\n\n3: Wait in the queue and beg them to reschedule me.\nTry to reschedule on my own and seek reimbursement.\nGive up, get on a flight, return home, and dial in.\n\n1: We prefer option 1: they should be able to get me to the meeting\n\n–1: It might take too long to wait in the queue, and I miss the opportunity to rebook myself.\n\n^Z: If that happens, I will get the next flight back to Berlin and dial in instead.\n\nNarrative Style\n\nIn the narrative style, often, you structure a 3-part story:\nThe current situation is as follows… (“the hero’s broken world”)\nWe should do this challenging thing (“the hero’s struggle”)\nIf we do that challenging thing, our world will look like this… (“the hero’s better world”).\n\nThere is a lot to read in the world on storytelling for business, and if you search for how Amazon 6-pagers are structured, you will see they generally are structured in this way (although not always described as such). This style is appropriate for more moon-shot proposals, where it is essential to go into considerable detail (6 pages worth) to describe the current situation, the recommendation, and the advantages.\n\nHere’s a simple example:\n\nBroken (current situation): We are en route Berlin -> London -> Seattle, but our flight out of Berlin was late, and we missed our connection by 10 minutes. After being denied entry to security because it was too close to take-off time, we find ourselves in a busy transfer area, with long queues everywhere we look. How can we get to Seattle?\n\nStruggle: We will enter the queue immediately and wait it out. No matter what it takes, this airline — of which we are long-term and loyal customers — will get us to Seattle no matter what. We will not take no for an answer.\n\nBetter: Even if we have to make three stops, even if we get no sleep, we will make it to Seattle because this airline has a duty of care, and we are prepared to do what it takes to get them to fix it.\n\nA narrative can be a risky style, but it can be highly effective. You can find a great example in Working Backwards by Bryar and Carr.\n\nCreate a {{Choose a structure like 5/3/1, Minto, Narrative Style}} formatted structure, with highlighted sections, for the problem in the following text: \n\n{{Type your problem here}}",

      "description": "Provide me a text and I will check if your text describes a proper \"mechanism\". A mechanism is a process that transforms controllable inputs into ongoing outputs to address a recurring business challenge.",
      "content": "Here's some information on mechanisms: Often, when we find a recurring problem, we pull the team together, ask them to try harder, and do better – essentially, we ask for good intentions. This rarely works. When asking for good intentions, you are not asking for a change because people already have good intentions. Mechanisms and mechanism-thinking to can drive consistent, measurable results, pushing beyond the boundaries of \"good intentions and trying hard.\" You can unlock significant productivity gains and foster a culture of accountability by transforming lofty goals into tangible outcomes, structured processes, and explicit feedback loops. Read on to understand mechanisms and their potential to propel long-term success and sustained impact. \n\nUnderstanding Mechanisms\n\nA mechanism is a process that transforms controllable inputs into ongoing outputs to address a recurring business challenge.\nMechanisms can be understood through five key elements:\nDesired Outcome: Identify the specific, measurable result you want to achieve.\n\nProcess-Driven and Repeatable: Create a clearly-defined, repeatable process to reach the desired outcome.\nScalable and Robust: Design mechanisms that can be applied at any scale and withstand varying conditions.\n\nFeedback and Learning: Incorporate feedback loops for continuous learning and improvement, keeping mechanisms relevant and effective.\n\nAdoption and Inspection: Ensure the tools or process are adopted, and the mechanism is inspected for correctness and completeness.\n\nApply mechanism-thinking by identifying outcomes, designing scalable and robust processes, and including feedback loops for improvement.\n\nExamples of Mechanisms\n\nTo illustrate the concept, let's consider a few examples of mechanisms that fit within this framework:\n\nAndon Cord: This mechanism, inspired by the manufacturing industry, is designed to maintain product quality and customer satisfaction. When team members identify a potential quality issue, they can metaphorically \"pull the andon cord\" to halt the process and address the problem. The process is repeatable, scalable for any employee, and includes feedback for continuous learning and improvement.\n\nDocument Review Process for MBRs: This mechanism promotes effective business performance tracking and decision-making. It involves preparing a detailed monthly document outlining key business metrics, achievements, challenges, and plans, followed by a structured meeting for review, discussion, and action planning. The MBR process is designed to be outcome-driven, process-driven, scalable, and robust, emphasizing feedback and learning.\n\nLeadership Foundation Performance Management and Hiring Process: Aligned with the Leadership Foundation, this mechanism aims to develop strong leaders who drive organizational success. Incorporating Leadership Values into hiring and performance management fosters a self-sustaining leadership development system. The process is outcome-driven, scalable, and robust, with a built-in feedback loop for continuous learning and improvement.\n\nMissing Mechanisms\n\nCertain activities, though well-intentioned, are stark examples of missing mechanisms. They only create an appearance of \"good intentions and trying hard.\" Here are some common examples:\n\nAd-hoc problem-solving: Addressing issues or improving processes through informal, one-off solutions rather than a structured, repeatable mechanism can lead to inconsistent results and not guarantee long-term improvements.\nIneffective meetings: Frequent meetings without clear objectives, agendas, or outcomes waste time and resources without driving meaningful change or improvements.\nOver-reliance on individual heroics: Employees working long hours or taking on multiple responsibilities without proper delegation or support can hinder the development of robust, scalable processes, leading to burnout and unsustainable work practices.\n\nLack of documentation: Undocumented processes, decisions, or best practices ensures a lack of consistency and missing clarity, relying on memory or informal communication, which does not guarantee knowledge transfer or successful action repeatability.\n\nInadequate performance management: Infrequent or vague feedback on performance fails to drive meaningful improvement or align individual efforts with organizational goals.\n\nInsufficient training and development: Sporadic or generic training programs without a clear connection to specific skills and knowledge required for employees' roles can result in a superficial appearance of investment without substantial skill growth.\n\nOveremphasis on short-term results: Exclusively focusing on immediate goals and deadlines while neglecting long-term strategy and process improvement can hinder the organization's ability to innovate and adapt to market demands.\nEach example lacks apparent outcomes, repeatable processes, scalability and robustness, and feedback loops for continuous learning and improvement. Transitioning to achieving consistent, sustainable results through operational excellence depends on us learning to spot where a missing mechanism wastes time and resources. Each of us building the capability to shift gears from spinning our wheels to spinning up appropriate and effective mechanisms is vital for unlocking a company's long-term success.\n\nDrawbacks and Mitigation Strategies\n\nAlthough embracing a mechanisms-driven mindset has benefits, it's essential to consider potential drawbacks and mitigation strategies:\n\nRigidity: Foster a culture of openness and adaptation to address potential inflexibilities. Regularly review and update mechanisms to ensure they remain relevant and practical.\nComplexity: Streamline mechanisms and provide clear documentation and training for employees to follow processes efficiently, minimizing complexity and promoting ease of use.\nTime and resource investment: Acknowledge that designing, implementing, and maintaining mechanisms can require significant time and resources. Prioritize developing mechanisms for critical processes, and assess potential returns before committing significant resources.\n\nResistance to change: Recognize that introducing new organizational mechanisms can be met with resistance from employees who are comfortable with existing processes or fear that the changes may negatively impact their work. To overcome this resistance, communicate the benefits and rationale behind the new mechanisms, and involve others in the development process to increase buy-in and reduce resistance.\nOveremphasis on the process: Focusing too much on the mechanism can sometimes detract from the desired outcome or goal. To maintain a balance, encourage yourself and others to remain results-oriented while adhering to the established processes.\n\nOne-size-fits-all approach: Understand that mechanisms may not always suit every situation or context. To maximize effectiveness, customize mechanisms for different units, teams, or markets, ensuring they are tailored to specific contexts and needs.\n\nAcknowledging potential drawbacks and applying mitigation strategies enables successful mechanism incorporation and a balanced, practical approach.\n\nWhen Solid Mechanisms Go Wrong\n\nSolids mechanisms often go wrong when:\nOne or more of the components is no longer working or relevant.\nAdoption has dwindled\nThe inspection process is no longer measuring the right things\nThe desired outcomes are no longer needed\n\nSome signals to watch for:\nInputs are not converting to outputs.\nOutputs not tied to a business challenge.\nProcess complexity outweighs output value.\nAdoptee complaints of “bureaucracy.”\nNo one really “owns” the mechanism.\n\nExamples:\nWeekly metric reviews with no outcomes or action items or the same action items come up every week.\nMonthly goal reviews with no feedback from senior leaders.\n\nConclusion\n\nEmbracing mechanism thinking is a powerful approach that can significantly enhance our performance by driving consistent results, boosting productivity, and fostering a culture of accountability and continuous improvement. Moving beyond mere \"good intentions and trying hard,\" we can leverage well-designed mechanisms to achieve operational excellence at scale. It is essential; however, we remain flexible and adaptive, ensuring that mechanisms are regularly reviewed, tailored to specific contexts, and balanced with a focus on desired outcomes. This approach unlocks mechanism thinking's full potential for long-term success and growth.\nI would like you to analyze the text below against the information above describing mechanisms.
